# zavedou – Stránky, které vás zavedou za vědou 🧑‍🔬
This is the final project of the retraining course (300+ hours) in Web Development Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js) organized by [Czechitas](https://www.czechitas.cz/) in 2020. Out of 16 projects, it was awarded as the best project of the course 🌟

The project is a website serving as a gateway to scientific activities for the public. Bára and Andra (contributors to this project) discovered that no centralized database of scientific institutions, scientists, science parks, and popularization activities exists in the Czech Republic. Therefore, they decided to create one as their final project 😊

It features an interactive map of scientific institutions, science parks in the Czech Republic, and other science popularization activities with filtering options. Further it includes a calendar of events, and a database with profiles of scientific popularizers who schools can invite to their premises. And so, the project zavedou was born – a site that takes you to science 🧑‍🔬
